The Ph.D. student will have opportunities to (1) develop statistical methods to identify risk genetic variants for human diseases and (2) implement proposed methods in R or Python. The Ph.D. student will receive rigorous training in statistical theory, statistical computing, and academic writing, which will prepare him/her for careers in both academia and industry.
