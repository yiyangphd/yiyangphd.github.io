I am looking for highly motivated PhD students to join my group in the Department of Biostatistics at City University of Hong Kong. The PhD students will have opportunities to (1) develop statistical methods to identify genetic risk variants for human diseases and (2) implement proposed methods in R or Python. The PhD students will receive rigorous training in statistical theory, statistical computing, and academic writing, which will prepare them for careers in both academia and industry.

### Qualification
- Strong programming skills in R or Python are **required**
- Interests and prior research experiences in **statistical genetics**
- A bachelor's degree and a master's degree in statistics, computer science, bioinformatics, data science, or related fields


### Application

Please send your resume/CV and transcript(s) to [yi.yang at cityu.edu.hk](mailto:yi.yang@cityu.edu.hk).* I will also work closely with qualified candidates to apply for the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS), which will provide an annual stipend of US$41,690, a travel allowance of US$1,740, and one year of free tuition and on-campus housing. 

\* I may not be able to respond to each applicant due to the high volume of applications received.
