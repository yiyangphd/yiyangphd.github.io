### R Packages

- [**KnockoffHybrid**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KnockoffHybrid): a knockoff framework for the identification of risk genetic variants in genome-wide association studies using hybrid analysis of both the trio and population designs.

- [**KnockoffTrio**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KnockoffTrio): a computationally efficient tool for the identification of causal loci in whole-genome sequencing family trio data. It also provides a meta-analysis module for combining the results of multiple studies. It implements the method in [**KnockoffTrio: A knockoff framework for the identification of putative causal variants in genome-wide association studies with trio design**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2022.08.013). 

- [**HSVS-M**](https://github.com/yiyangphd/HSVSM): a Bayesian method for multi-variant multi-trait association testing using summary statistics. It implements the method in [**A Bayesian hierarchically structured prior for gene-based association test with multiple traits in genome-wide association studies**](https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22437). 

- [**HSVS-A**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_6qtqkPqM8icAB1oMOdYG83aV1VLY4G2/view?usp=sharing): a Bayesian method for rare-variant association testing. It implements the method in [**A Bayesian hierarchically structured prior for rare‚Äêvariant
association testing**](https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22379).
