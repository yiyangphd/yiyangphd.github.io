### R Packages

- [**KnockoffTrio**](https://github.com/yiyangphd/KnockoffTrio): a computationally efficient tool for the identification of causal loci in whole-genome sequencing family trio data. It also provides a meta-analysis module for combining the results of multiple studies. It implements the method in **KnockoffTrio: A knockoff framework for the identification of putative causal variants in genetic association studies with trio design**. The package is also available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KnockoffTrio).

- [**HSVS-M**](https://github.com/yiyangphd/HSVSM): a Bayesian method for multi-variant multi-trait association testing using summary statistics. It implements the method in [**A Bayesian hierarchically structured prior for gene-based association test with multiple traits in genome-wide association studies**](https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22437). 

- **HSVS-A**: a Bayesian method for rare-variant association testing. It implements the method in [**A Bayesian hierarchically structured prior for rare‚Äêvariant
association testing**](https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22379). The package is in progress.
