### R Packages

- [**KnockoffTrio**](https://github.com/yiyangphd/KnockoffTrio): a computationally efficient tool for the identification of causal loci in whole-genome sequencing family trio data. It also provides a meta-analysis module for combining the results of multiple studies. It implements the method in **KnockoffTrio: A knockoff framework for the trio design**. The package has been completed and will be available to the public shortly.

- [**HSVS-M**](https://github.com/yiyangphd/HSVSM): a Bayesian method for multi-variant multi-trait association testing using summary statistics. It implements the method in **A Bayesian hierarchically structured prior for gene-based association test with multiple traits in genome-wide association studies**. 

- **HSVS-A**: a Bayesian method for rare-variant association testing. It implements the method in [**A Bayesian hierarchically structured prior for rare‚Äêvariant
association testing**](https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22379). The package is in progress.
