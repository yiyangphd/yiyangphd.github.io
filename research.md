My research has focused on the variable selection methods in Bayesian statistics and knockoff statistics for high-dimensional data. Variable selection, also known as feature selection, is at the heart of many scientific problems, such as discovering pathogenic variants in human genome.

### 1. Bayesian hierarchical models for variable selection

A typical task in many scientific problems is to find important factors in predicting an outcome variable. This task is further complicated by the fact that a factor may consist of a group of variables. I work on statistical methods in this context to identify important (groups of) variables. In particular, I have developed a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that can achieve group selection and within-group variable selection simultaneously. The proposed methods can also account for various correlation structures between the variables. 

### 2. Knockoff statistics for variable selection

False discoveries render research findings irreproducible, a long-standing challenge to researchers. They often occur when the truly important factors are correlated with the non-important ones. I work on knockoff statistics to design knockoff variables that preserve the correlation structure of the original variables. This property allows a variable selection procedure based on the knockoff variables to control the false discovery rate in the presence of correlation between the important and non-important variables.
