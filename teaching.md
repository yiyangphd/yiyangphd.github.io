## Student Feedback
- "The balance of providing methodological intuition followed by in–depth examples of applied analyses using R. Dr. Yang's lectures were consistently clear and well–paced. The quality of the lecture materials and taught–sessions were among the best I've encountered at CityU." - BIOS5802, Spring 2024
- "The course is very well designed in terms of its course content and the way the professor taught it. Prof. Yi Yang teaches well and really knows what he is talking about. There is a lot of statistical thinking one can learn from him by listening closely. He is one of the best lecturers I have had the privilege to take a course with." - SDSC3105, Fall 2023
