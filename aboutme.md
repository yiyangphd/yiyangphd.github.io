My research focuses on variable selection methods for high-dimensional data using knockoff statistics and Bayesian hierarchical models. I have developed a number of statistical methods to identify risk variants for human diseases in genetic datasets with complex hierarchical and correlation structures. I also worked as the principal statistician on several collaborative projects with physician researchers. My research interests include high-dimensional variable selection, statistical genetics, knockoff statistics, and Bayesian hierarchical models.
